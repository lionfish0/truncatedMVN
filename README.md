# truncatedMVN
Sample from a truncated MVN. You need to specify the mean and covariance of
the multivariate normal (MVN), and the normals to the planes that will
truncate this MVN. We assume for this version that the planes pass through
the origin (as this was our use case).

# Installation Instructions

Run:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/lionfish0/truncatedMVN.git
```
